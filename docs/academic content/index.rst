Workshops

Analog Devices is as passionate about educating the next generation of young
circuit design engineers as it is about pioneering the next technological
breakthroughs.
The University Program is a platform where Analog Devices, working with leading
educational institutions has created and deployed new hands on learning tools
for the next generation of design engineers. We feel that hands on, experiential
learning is a key success factor, we don’t only think with our heads; we also
think with our hands.

The University Program brings the technology the company has developed to the
academic community in a way that is open and accessible to faculty and students
in the form of analog design kits and analog components, online and downloadable
software and teaching materials, online support, textbooks, reference designs and
lab projects to enrich students’ education about analog, digital, and power circuits
and their application to core engineering and physical science.
